# Crowdfunding analysis
## Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
- Theater had the most campaigns by category compared to any other categories as well as the highest number of successful campaigns with 187. Specifically, Plays, a sub-category of theater, had the most campaigns by sub-category too - far beyond the next closest sub-category of rock, a sub-category of music, at 49.
- Despite the campaign's Goal range, 73% of campaigns were successful on avergae. The best success rate occurred when the campaign's Goal was between 15000 to 19999, 20000 to 24999, or 30000 to 34999. In each of these Goal ranges, the success rate was 100%.
- Looking at all years (2010 to 2020), Campaigns launched in June and July were more successful (had a higher number of successful campaigns) than campaigns launched in any other month. This could be due to June and July being after school / during summer vacation when crowdfunding efforts were able to engage with to more people or attract a higher number of people to donate or pledge to their cause. Overall, this data point helps us understand the seasonality of campaigns.
- The U.S. had the highest number of campaigns when compared to the other conutries in the dataset - Australia, Switzerland, Denmark, Canada, Great Britian, Italy, and China.

## What are some limitations of this dataset?
- Limited data points to make analysis?
- Limited timeframe?
- Currency differs between campaigns making it challenging to review financial impacts from a single monetoary number like USD. There could obviously be some additional data preparation to convert all currencies to a single currency like USD. 
- No demographic information about backers; having more information would allow us to analyze who is making donations, what age they are, where they live, what their income is. Also, would allow us to review campaign effectiveness across demographics and target audiences.

## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
- Correlation between funding goal, pledged amount and outcome
  - With a correlation graph between funding goal, pledged amount and outcome, we would be able to review the impact campaign funding had on the outcome and determine if there is a threshold or target that could be identified for future campaigns.
- Campaign outcomes by country
  - This would have assisted with drawing conclusions about which location has the best success rate for crowdsourcing campaigns and parhaps where future crowdfunding campaigns should be held.
  - This could be represented in either a pie chart with total campaigns (country legend), a stacked bar chart with count of campaign outcome (country on x axis). 
- Category trends by year, by success rate, by average donation
  - This would assist with reviewing trends of successful campaigns over time to see which campaign cateogies are successful within the most recent years to better determine if a crowdfunding campaign may be a viable option to raise awareness and captial for the mission. If the crowdfunding efforts are unsuccessful within your category or domain, this information would enable alternative money raising efforts to be considered and implemented.
  - It would also assist with determining an estimated success rate and a target for average donation amount to be successful.
- Average donation by country, by year, by category
  - This would assist with drawing conclusions about expected average donations per location to be in order to track and gauge donations actively during a new campaign and take action to remediate low donation amounts.
  - Average doantions could also be reviewed year over year, month over month to analyze percent increase or decrease.
  - Average donations could also be reviewed by category to understand typical donation size per category.
