# Crowdfunding analysis
## Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
- Theater had the most campaigns by category compared to any other categories as well as the highest number of successful campaigns with 187. Specifically, Plays, a sub-category of theater, had the most campaigns by sub-category too - far beyond the next closest sub-category of rock, a sub-category of music, at 49.
- The U.S. had the highest number of campaigns when compared to any other country.
- Despite the campaign's Goal range, 73% of campaigns were successful on avergae. The best success rate occurred when the campaign's Goal was between 15000 to 19999, 20000 to 24999, or 30000 to 34999. In each of these Goal ranges, the success rate was 100%.
- Looking at all years, Campaigns launched in June and July were more successful (had a higher number of successful campaigns) than campaigns launched in any other month. Perhaps this is due to June and July being after school / during summer vacation when crowdfunding efforts were able to talk to more people or attract a higher number of people to donate or pledge to their cause.

## What are some limitations of this dataset?
- Currency differs between campaigns making it challenging to review financial impacts.

## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
- Correlation between Percent Funded and Outcome
  -- With a correlation graph between percent funded and outcome, we would be able to review the impact campaign funding had on the outcome and determine if there is a threshold or target that could be identified for future campaigns.
- Campaign outcomes by country
  --  This would have assisted with drawing conclusions about which location has the best success rate for crowdsourcing campaigns and parhaps where future crowdfunding campaigns should be held.
- Category trends by year, by success rate, by average donation
  -- Determine the most successful campaigns with percent success rate
  -- review trends of successful campaigns over time to see which campaign cateogies are successful within the most recent years to better determine if a crowdfunding campaign may be a viable option to raise awareness and captial for your mission. if the crowdfunding efforts are unsuccessful within your category or domain, this information would enable alternative money raising efforts to be considered and implemented.
- Average donation by country, by year
